## About The Project

The GameDex is a video game tracking website built using the IGDB database API that allows you to create, update, rate, and delete logs of video games that you have played.
This repository encompasses the backend server of the project. You can explore the [client-side code](https://github.com/madison-nicole/video-game-tracker-api) or enjoy the deployed, fully-functional [site](https://video-game-tracker-m7cr.vercel.app/)!

### Server Functionality and Technology

<p>
  For this project, I built an Express.js/MongoDB API server for the video game tracking website.</p>
  <p>The server allows for:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>saving a new game (with or without a rating)</li>
  <li>deleting a game by ID</li>
  <li>updating a game by ID</li>
  <li>fetching all of a user's saved games</li>
  <li>fetching an individual game</li>
  <li>fetching a user's profile information</li>
 </ul>
